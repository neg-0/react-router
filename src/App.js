// Create a simple mockup of an ecommerce site (resembling an online store). Don't worry, this is just a mockup, so it doesn't have to have images or a functioning payment system!

// Use React Router to make this a single-page-app that can change its view via the routes (tip - use a navbar along the top with buttons).

// It should feature routes to the following components:

// Home page
// Products page
// Individual product page
// View cart
// Checkout page
